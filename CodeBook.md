The `run_analysis.R` script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition.

Transformations
---------------

1. Download the dataset
    - Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assign each data to variables
    - `features <- features.txt` : 561 rows, 2 columns
          The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw            signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
    - `activityLabels <- activity_labels.txt` : 6 rows, 2 columns
          List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes                (labels)
    - `subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt` : 2947 rows, 1 column
          contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
    - `xtest <- test/X_test.txt` : 2947 rows, 561 columns
          contains recorded features test data
    - `ytest <- test/y_test.txt` : 2947 rows, 1 columns
          contains test data of activities'code labels
    - `subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt` : 7352 rows, 1 column
          contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
    - `xtrain <- test/X_train.txt` : 7352 rows, 561 columns
          contains recorded features train data
    - `ytrain <- test/y_train.txt` : 7352 rows, 1 columns
          contains train data of activities'code labels

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    - `data_train` (7352 rows, 563 columns) is created by merging `ytrain`, `subject_train` and `xtrain`               using `cbind()` function
    - `data_test` (2947 rows, 563 column) is created by merging `ytest`, `subject_test` and `xtest` using              `cbind()` function
    - `data_main` (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, `data_train` and `data_test`               using `rbind()` function

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    - `mean_and_std` (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting `data_main`, selecting only columns: `subjectID`, `actividyID` and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement.

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Entire numbers in `activityID` column of the `mean_and_std` replaced with corresponding `activityLabels` taken from second column of the activities variable and a new database called `data_merge` 

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    - `activityID` is eliminate
    - All `Acc` in column's name replaced by `Accelerometer`
    - All `Gyro` in column's name replaced by `Gyroscope`
    - All `BodyBody` in column's name replaced by `Body`
    - All `Mag` in column's name replaced by `Magnitude`
    - All start with character `f` in column's name replaced by `Frequency`
    - All start with character `t` in column's name replaced by `Time`

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    - `FinalData` (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing `data_merge` taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
    - Export `FinalData` into `FinalData.txt` file.

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
> 
> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
> 
> For each record it is provided:
> ======================================
> 
> - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
> - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
> - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
> - Its activity label. 
> - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
